Dictionary 3.0

Written by Diego Conti, diego.conti@unimib.it, 2008-2015.

A library to compute the space of invariant forms on an associated bundle G\times_H V, where H acts sphere-transitively on V, using a method introduced informally in [BS], and studied in detail in [DC].
Information on the groups and representation is hard-coded in the header files contained in the subdirectories groups, representations and dictionaries.
At the moment, the implemented dictionaries are 
	SU(3)\times_SU(2)\R^3, SU(3)\times_SO(3)\R^3
and two dictionaries of the form
	SU(3)\times_U(2) C^2, with different actions of U(2) on the fibre.
